##  Installation  
To install from source first [install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), clone the repository, then build:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/t-young31/soap-rust.git
cd soap-rust
cargo build --release
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Requires linking against [GSL](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/).


##  Usage  
Execute the binary built in the *targets/release/* directory. For example to generate the 'SOAP vector' for the density of all of the Na and Cl in a Nacl lattice:

```bash
target/release/soap -f=./nacl_test.xyz -c=0 -s Na -s  Cl
```

where the first argument is the .xyz structure file, the second the atom index of the origin and the third the element comprising the neighbours. See the help for all options:

```bash
target/release/soap --help
```


## Testing  
Rust provides a awesome testing platform so the tests can be run  with:

```bash
cargo test
```
